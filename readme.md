# Gauntlet

## Description

A hackathon project to foster competition. Probably unhealthy.

### Getting the NodeJS Server Running

You need the mongodb native driver, and express. In order to install the MongoDB native driver, you'll need mongoDB client libraries on your system, otherwise ``npm install -g mongodb`` will fail.

You also need ejs installed, so you'll need to run ``npm install -g ejs`` as well.
